This repository contains a small number of PHP challenges.

Each challenge is documented in a comment at the top of the file.

The following should be considered to apply to all challenges:

 * Use modern PHP (5.3+) to solve them
 * Follow best practice throughout
 * It would be helpful if you could list your sources (assuming any are used) in
   a comment at the end of the file
 * Don't copy & paste from other sites
